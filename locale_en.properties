events.header=Events
events.text=The model is similar to the model of oscillations. The system derived from the balance state tends to \
balance with velocities a1 and a2. Balance state - the value of wages and employment, which suit the workers and the employer.
events.example1=An example of "Balance" is selected. The system is initially in equilibrium and the system is unchanged.
events.example2=An example of "Too big salary" is selected. This is the case when the salary is higher than the balance \
value and The employer will reduce it until it reaches the balance state of the salary. Since the salary was higher \
than the value of balance, the number of employed will increase as long as the salary decreases. As soon as the salary \
falls below the value the number of people will decrease until they reach the balance of employment. After this, the \
system will repeat its fluctuations.
events.dec.a1=The coefficient of wage change has been reduced. \nThis leads to an increase in the time needed to achieve equilibrium.
events.inc.a1=The coefficient of wage change has been increased. \nThis leads to a reduction in the time needed to achieve equilibrium.
events.dec.a2=The coefficient of change in the number of employed people has been reduced. \nThe system will move to the equilibrium state more slowly.
events.inc.a2=The coefficient of change in the number of employed people has been increased. \nThe system will move to the equilibrium state faster.
events.dec.P0=Уменьшено значение зарплаты в начале исследования.
events.inc.P0=Increased salary at the beginning of the study.
events.dec.N0=Reduced the importance of busy people at the beginning of the study.
events.inc.N0=Increased the value of employed people at the beginning of the study.
events.dec.Pr=Reduced the value of wages in an equilibrium state.
events.inc.Pr=The value of wages in the equilibrium state is increased.
events.dec.Nr=The value of employed people is reduced in the balance state.
events.inc.Nr=The value of employed people in the balance state is increased.
events.dec.T=Decreased the time of observation.
events.inc.T=Increased the time of observation.
events.dec.N=The number of grid nodes has been reduced. This will lead to a faster decision time.
events.inc.N=Increased number of grid nodes. This will lead to a longer decision time.

about.header.theory=Tab "Mathematical model"
about.header.model=Tab "Theoretical material"
about.textarea.theory=The content allows you to get acquainted with the theoretical basics used in implementing this model.
about.textarea.model=The content consists of three parts: the graphics panel, the parameters panel and the event pane. \
  \nPanel parameters consists of parameters and buttons. The graph is drawn automatically when one of the \
  parameters has been changed. For each parameter there is a hint. It appears when you hold the mouse cursor over the title \
  parameter or its value. \
  \n\na1 - coefficient of salary change \n\na2 - coefficient of change of employed \
  \n\nP0 - salary at the beginning of the research \n \nN0 - the number of occupied places at the beginning of the study \
  \n\nPr - salary value at the beginning of the study (balance) \n\nNr - the number of occupied places at the beginning of the study (balance) \n \
  \n\nT - time of observation \n\nN - number of partitions in time \n\n \
  To change the parameters, you can enter a value from the keyboard and press ENTER or using the slider using the mouse \
  or the "left" and "right" arrows. \
  \n\nThe "Balance" button adjusts the parameters to achieve the balance state. \
  \n\nThe "Salary too high" button adjusts the parameters to reach a state where the salary is above the balance value and \
  The employer will reduce it until it reaches the balance state of the salary. \
  \n\nThe event bar contains information about the actions performed by the user that affect the chart of the model.
